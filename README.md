#  Personal Finance Manager

A simple and beginner-friendly application that helps users manage their finances effectively. This project was built entirely from scratch using **Python** and **Streamlit** to practice Object-Oriented Programming, modular code design, and building a basic UI.

---

##  Description

Personal Finance Manager allows users to:

- Set and track financial goals
- Import and export data
- View and manage their goals
- Handle data easily with a simple Streamlit interface

The project started as a console application and later upgraded with a web-based interface using Streamlit.
